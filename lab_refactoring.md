We worked on refactoring the classes related to Wator (Wator, WatorSquareCell, etc.). There was a lot of repeated code in 
these files. SharkWatorCell had a couple of lines that were duplicated so I extracted a method there. I also extracted a method out from DeadGOLSquareCell and LiveGOLSquareCell. I also refactored the constructor for WatorSquareCell.
