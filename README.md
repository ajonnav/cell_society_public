##Impressions:
The group thought that overall we didn't design the grid well originally during the first week and as a result spent most of the week working on the new data structure and not on the new features. We ended up running out of time to debug and fix many of the elements we were trying to implement. In the future it might be nice to be able to know in advance some options that might be need to be implemented for week 2 so that we could make a better design from the beginning.
