Duke CompSci 308 Cell Society Project
Name: Colin, Ani, Christine

##Date Started: January 26
##Date Finished: Februrary 14

##Names of People who worked on project: Ani, Christine, Colin

##Date I Started: January 26
##Date I finished: February 14
##Time Spent: 30 hours for first sprint, and about 30 hours for the second sprint

##Team Roles in Developing:
Colin developed the Grid Interface, Slots and the Segregation Simulation, Half of the Grid Factory, the Direction Vector 		Class, refactoring of other people's code


Ani developed XML parser, Game of Life, WaTor Simulation, Other half of grid factory, CA, refactoring of other people's code


Christine developed Front End UI, Fire, All of Foraging Ants, the math for getting the hexagonal grid points 

##any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project
None
##files used to start the project (the class(es) containing main)
Main needed to Initialize simulation Screen

##files used to test the project
Fire_1, Fire_2, gol_1, gol_2, gol_3, gol_DEFAULT, Seg_1, Seg_2, Seg_3, Seg_DEFAULT wator_1, wator_2, wator_3, wator_DEFAULT

### Any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)
Everything in the Resource Bundle is required for displaying errors and for setting defaults. XML files in the folder 'resources' are for running the simulations. The images in 'resources' are used for backgrounds.
### Any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)
You need to load in XML files to run the simulations.
### Any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality
The only simulations that really work are Game of Life, Segregation and Fire with square-shaped grids and torroidal or finite edges. We worked on implementing other features and simulations but were not able to make them work.
### Any extra features included in the project
None.
### Your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future
##Impressions:
The group thought that overall we didn't design the grid well originally during the first week and as a result spent most of the week working on the new data structure and not on the new features. We ended up running out of time to debug and fix many of the elements we were trying to implement. In the future it might be nice to be able to know in advance some options that might be need to be implemented for week 2 so that we could make a better design from the beginning.
