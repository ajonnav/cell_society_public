Duke CompSci 308 Cell Society Project
Colin, Ani, Christine

### names of all people who worked on the project
### date you started, date you finished, and an estimate of the number of hours worked on the project
### each person's role in developing the project
### any books, papers, online, or human resources that you used in developing the project
### files used to start the project (the class(es) containing main)
### files used to test the project
### any data or resource files required by the project (including format of non-standard files)
Everything in the Resource Bundle is required for displaying errors and for setting defaults. XML files in the folder 'resources' are for running the simulations. The images in 'resources' are used for backgrounds.
### any information about using the program (i.e., command-line/applet arguments, key inputs, interesting example data files, or easter eggs)
You need to load in XML files to run the simulations.
### any known bugs, crashes, or problems with the project's functionality
The only simulations that really work are Game of Life, Segregation and Fire with square-shaped grids and torroidal or finite edges. We worked on implementing other features and simulations but were not able to make them work.
### any extra features included in the project
None.
### your impressions of the assignment to help improve it in the future
