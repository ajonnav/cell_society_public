## Introduction

This section describes the problem your team is trying to solve by writing this program, the primary design goals of the project (i.e., where is it most flexible), and the primary architecture of the design (i.e., what is closed and what is open). This section should discuss the program at a high-level (i.e., without referencing specific classes, data structures, or code).

The goal of this program is to animate 2-D cellular automata (CA) simulations. The primary design goal for this project is to be able to handle different types of simulations (different sets of rules) and different cell shapes. The program will read the specifications for the simulation via a XML configuration file. This file will contain information about which simulation to animate, the initial cell states and global parameters that are specific to the simulation. The program will then draw the initial state of the cells and repeatedly update the cells based on the rules until the simulation 'finishes'. The user will be able to start and stop the simulation as well as control the pace of the simulation. He/she will also be able to switch between simulations by loading in a different XML configuration file.

##Overview

In this program, there are a couple major components that will be necessary to create in order for the design to be dynamic and flexible for any CA scenario. As such, the goal for our developing is to craft classes that capture the fundamental principles of Cellular Automata.  

Our overview begins with a basic layout of how the program will be separated [class diagram]  (https://github.com/duke-compsci308-spring2016/cellsociety_team19/blob/master/resources/ClassDiagram.pdf):

**Main Class**:

* This class is responsible for initializing/changing CA's.
* Extends Application and therefore will have override the start method.
* Within this, there will be a call to the XMLArgs class.  This information will be used to create a new Instance of the CA class.
* The stage will be set such that the button bar at the bottom will remain throughout the program
* The window above the stage will be updated in Animation as the simulation goes on.
* Once the grid is initialized, CA will call its run method to being the simulation.
* The CA object will run the animation as well as the simulation updating
* The CA can be paused and switched to different simulations from the Main Class.
	

**XMLAargs**

* Parses information from XML file about specific automaton.
	
**CA**

* Each Simulation will be an instance of this class.
* parameters include: number of cells, shape of cells, rules, cell states
* our cell objects will be stored in a Graph data structure stored as a 2D array for its neighbors.
* States will be stored in a collection with index numbers
* Global list of cells will be used to for simulation steps 
* The Simulation loop will carry out the following tasks:
	
1. Update cells using the rules and neighbors in order to determine the state
2. Render the cells for the current step of the simulation
3. Determine if the simulation is over

**Cell**

* Will store it's state - a constant determined from the CA class, and double x, y, coordinate location
* Abstract method draw will be over-ridden depending on the shape of the cell. 
* private int state will reference an index in CA data structure containing possible states. 
* getState and setState will be public methods the CA uses to adjust the cells in that step of the simulation.
	

By discretely laying out the various parts of the data in separate classes, I believe that our design will have the ability to adjust dynamically to different automatons.  We have isolated the principles of automata and separated them.  From basic development, we can add features with ease off of the foundational framework.    
	
##User Interface

The user interface to start with will have buttons that will allow the user to naviagate between screens. The first screen after the program is started will be the splash screen that says "Cell Society". On this screen, there will be buttons for each of the different cell animations under this. Above the button there will be text that says the name of the animation.

 In the first week with the basic design, to adjust factors such as the size of the animation or things such as color to color percentage in the model of segregation, the user will change the XML file to change the different factors related to the game. There will be a button to upload a new XML file on the splash screen for the beginning. Later, the splash screen will give options to change the animation. There will be a splash screen and another window, the "display screen" that has the animation and the buttons related to the animation. On the display screen, text boxes or sliders will eventually be used for user input to adjust the different factors for each animation. The program will also have default settings if the user does not choose to input settings.There will also be other buttons on the screen for the user to choose to reset, start, pause, and step through the animation as well.

To switch between screens, the user would close the display window and select another animation or upload an XML from the splash screen that remains open.

When a user enters erroneous information, a dialog will pop up telling the user that there has been an error and what kind of error was generated.

## Design Details
**Cell** abstract class will hold the private int variables for the current state, next state, and a double array of size two that holds location as x and y coordinates. The different sub-classes of cell for example would be *squareCell* or *triangleCell* or whatever type of cell shape we might want to have. The cell sub-classes will also have different public drawing methods to draw the cell shape, color, etc. Other methods that will be included are getter and setter methods for the current state and next state of the cell.

**CA** class will be a superclass that will have different subclasses for each simulation. Game of life, law of segregation, fire, and other simulations will each have a subclass of CA. The CA will store in private variables the number of cells and height and width. Each different subclass for CA for each different game will also have its own private static final int for the different states for the different games (i.e. private static final int FIRE = #).  In the constructor of the CA, the CA will take an parameter that is an object created by parseXML that hold the information for those private variables. CA's 2D array holds a 0 or 1 that states whether a cell is a neighbor with another cell and a list that contains all the cells. We are also considering perhaps using a Hashmap to store the cell as a key and a list of neighbors as the value. Methods for stepping through the animation, updating the cells, drawing all the cells, and initializing the animation screen will be included CA class. The method for initializing is public and will be called from the main class. This will create a new timeline, set the 2D array and list, and use the object passed from the parseXML class to set the variables for cell numbers, height, width, etc. The step method for CA class will call updateCells to update the next state of the cell based on the rules and then call drawCells to loop through all the different cells and draw the cell based on its next state. 

__Use Cases__


*Apply the rules to the middle cell*: The CA in the step method will go through the list of cells to update all of the cells's next state. In update state, the CA will look at the current state of the cell and check through the graph the current states of all of its neighbors. Then after all the next states for the cells have been updated there the cells will be looped through again to change current state to what next state is. Then, the CA based on the Game of Life rules will set the next state of the middle cell to "dead". Then the drawCells method will loop through all the cells and draw the new cell based on its next state and the animation continues.

*Apply the rules to the middle cell*: The CA in the step method will go through the list of cells to update all of the cells's next state. In updateCells, the CA will look at the current state of the cell and check through the graph the current states of all of its neighbors. Then using the rules for the game, the next state of that cell will be determined and updated. 

*Apply the rules to an edge cell*: Applying the rules to the edge cell will be the same as applying to rules to a middle cell because the CA class contains the Graph with a 2D array of all its neighbors and goes through the array to check each cells neighbors each update.

*Move to the next generation*: The updatingCells will update each cell's next state based on its neighbor's current state. After all the next states for the cells have been updated, the list with the cells will be looped through again to change current state to what next state is. Then the drawCells method will loop through all the cells and draw the new cell based on its next state and the animation continues.

## Design Considerations

At this stage of the project, we are making decisions that should allow for flexibility down the road for additional features as well as changes in requirements.   For example, our decision to use a graph structure instead of a grid should allow us to develop more more complex simulations in the future.  We are still deciding on which specific data structure we are going to use for our adjacency composition.  Another issue we are considering is how we will create an organized and consistent way of creating rules for how the cells interact with each other.  An independent object will take the results of the XML parsing and format the data so that the CA class can gather the necessary information for the simulation.  


In our consideration of animating the simulation, we have decided to use the AnimationTimer() javaFX class to step through each part of the simulation.  This should give us more control over the workings of the game in comparison to Timeline. Another design consideration is our use of Canvas to draw our objects.  Instead of creating several nodes into our scene, each simulation is going to be drawn on a canvas object.  We are still debating about what we are going to do when we switch between simulations.  As of now, each CA will have its own canvas, and as the CA's are created and used, their respective canvases will be brought to the front.  In other words, we are not deleting any CA objects, we are simply pausing and/or reseting their simulations and bringing it to front.

Having the CA object handle the rule checking was different from our original intention which was to have the cells check each other.  We realized it would have been redundant for each cell to have its own copy of the rules and have to check and apply with their neighbors.  Having the simulation manage state changes will prevent redundancy as well as contradictions that may arise as the result of each cell individually changing and checking its state.  


## Team Responsibilities

For the first round of this project, we have decided to break up the work in the following way:

1. Ani will be responsible for creating the XMLParsing and results classes.
2. Christine will create the Main class and the basic UI.
3. Colin will develop the Cell class.

Our goal is to have these pieces built by the end of the day Tuesday, so that we may all begin to work on the creation of the CA class.  This will take up the rest of the week as we work towards getting the program up and running.   

We will all work in our respective branches and plan to commit once a major component of each class is completed, and at the end of each working session.  We will also try to pull back in to the master branch at the end of each day.  

We plan to convene to plan how we are going to implement CA sometime on either Tuesday or Wednesday once we have the separate components completed.
